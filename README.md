These are my course notes from Dr. Hamilton's *Wave Phenomena* class, spring 2024. I will keep it updated as the semester progresses. 

The homepage is linked explicitly here: [https://chiragokani.github.io/wave/index.html](https://chiragokani.github.io/wave/index.html)

In case this page is down, that is because I am repairing/updating it. Try navigating to the subpages 
- [https://chiragokani.io/wave/1.html](https://chiragokani.github.io/wave/1.html)
- [https://chiragokani.github.io/wave/2.html](https://chiragokani.github.io/wave/2.html)
- etc
  
in the meantime.
